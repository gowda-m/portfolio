## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Gowda M**, an IT professional with strong hands-on experience in **Linux system administration, server operations, and DevOps engineering**. I have worked extensively in enterprise environments managing **SLES and Ubuntu servers**, virtualization platforms like **Proxmox and VMware ESXi**, and container technologies including **Docker**.

I specialize in designing and maintaining **secure, stable, and automated infrastructure**, with deep experience in **Active Directory–integrated Linux systems**, **LVM storage management**, filesystem mounting, and enterprise-grade **backup solutions using Veeam and Proxmox backup integration**. I have implemented **automated backup, monitoring, and system health-check scripts using Shell scripting**.

On the DevOps side, I have hands-on exposure to **CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins**, application deployment and management with **WildFly**, and dependency management tools such as **Maven, Node.js, and Angular**. I actively use **GitHub for version control and collaboration**, and I am building automation workflows using **Ansible playbooks** to simplify configuration management and deployment.

I am continuously strengthening my skills in **CI/CD automation, infrastructure automation, containerization, and cloud-ready DevOps practices**, with a strong focus on delivering **scalable, reliable, and production-ready systems**.
